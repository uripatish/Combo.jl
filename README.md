Julia versions: working on v0.6, version for 0.7/1.0 will be available sometime soon. 

Install by executing in the REPL,

`Pkg.clone("git://github.com/uripatish/Combo.jl.git")` 

See help by using `?` at the REPL. To browse Combo's functionality use `?Combo`, and `?` for any particular function exported by Combo (e.g. `?cakewalk`). Documention pages will be available sometime soon. 

If you use cakewalk in an academic work, please make sure to cite the following paper,
